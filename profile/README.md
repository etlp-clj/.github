## ETLP - Efficient Data Processing in Clojure

ETLP is a powerful Clojure library that simplifies the implementation of parallel concurrency and provides an efficient way to build data connectors. It leverages the concept of transducers and is based on the CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) pattern. ETLP allows developers to easily incorporate best practices when working with data streams, with the intent of making it a go-to library for data processing in Clojure.

## Features
- Built on the concept of transducers and CSP pattern.
- Simplifies the implementation of parallel concurrency.
- Allows decoupling of data mapping logic (business logic) from code using etlp-mapper.
- Supports a wide range of source and destination processors.
